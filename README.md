# Counting-to-one-hundred-in-Go
The source code does not contain any numbers, yet it outputs every digit between 1 and 100.

It achieves this by using the default int value as a stand-in for zero, and the length of an array to stand-in for 100, and uses a for loop between the two.

The code works properly with go1.19.4
